# Advent of Code 2024 :christmas_tree: :calendar:

This repository contains my solutions for the [2024 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) programming puzzle challenge.

In 2020, I used this challenge to teach myself some [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).  Because of that, I found myself enjoying the challenge of working in such a low-level language, especially since most of my day-to-day work is in high-level Javascript/Typescript web app development.  That's why, even though I haven't fully completed a challenge since then, I've returned each year to try again, and so here I am once more.  But most importantly, now, at long last, I write Rust as part of my day job!  Sometimes!

Does that mean I'm less, well, rusty?  Probably not!  Let's find out.

My prior years' solutions are available on the [2020](https://github.com/MechanicalMann/AdventOfCode/tree/2020), [2021](https://github.com/MechanicalMann/AdventOfCode/tree/2021), [2022](https://github.com/MechanicalMann/AdventOfCode/tree/2022), and [2023](https://github.com/MechanicalMann/AdventOfCode/tree/2023) branches in this repo.
